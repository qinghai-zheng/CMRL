%DEMO_RLR  Example of use of the RLR solver
%
%   We present an example of the RLR solver through an image reconstruction problem.
%   The problem can be expressed as this
%
%        argmin ||Ax-b||^2 + tau*||x||_TV
%
%   Where b is the degraded image, I the identity and A an operator representing the mask.
%
%   We set 
%
%    f_1(x)=||x||_{TV}
%     We define the prox of f_1 as: 
%
%        prox_{f1,gamma} (z) = argmin_{x} 1/2 ||x-z||_2^2  +  gamma ||z||_TV

%   Results
%   -------
%
%   Figure 1: Original image
%
%      This figure shows the original Lena image. 
%
%   Figure 2: Depleted image
%
%      This figure shows the image after the application of the mask. Note
%      that 50% of the pixels have been removed.
%
%   Figure 3: Reconstruted image
%
%      This figure shows the reconstructed image thanks to the algorithm.

%% Initialisation

clear all;
close all;

% Loading toolbox
init_unlocbox();

verbose = 2;    % verbosity level

%% Defining the problem

tau = 0.1; % Regularization parameter for the problem

% Original image
im_original = lena();

% Creating the problem
A=rand(size(im_original));
A=(A>0.5);
% Depleted image
b=A.*im_original;

% Defining the adjoint operator
A_op = @(x) A.*x;
At_op = @(x) A.*x;

%% Define the proximal operator

% setting the function f1 (norm TV)
param_tv.verbose = verbose - 1;
param_tv.maxit = 50;

f.prox=@(x, T) prox_tv(x, T*tau, param_tv);
f.eval=@(x) tau*norm_tv(x);   

%% Solving the problem

% setting different parameters for the simulation
param.verbose = verbose;    % display parameter
param.maxit = 40;           % maximum iteration
param.epsilon = 10e-5;      % tolerance to stop iterating
param.gamma = 0.5;          % stepsize (beta is equal to 2)
param.method = 'FISTA';     % desired method for solving the problem

% solving the problem
