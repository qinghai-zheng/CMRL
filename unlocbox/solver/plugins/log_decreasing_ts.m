function gamma = log_decreasing_ts(x, gamma_in, gamma_fin, nit)
%LOG_DECREASING_TS Log decreasing timestep for UNLCOBOX algorithm
%   Usage gamma = log_decreasing_ts(x, gamma_in, gamma_fin, nit);
%
%   Input parameters:
%         x         : Structure of data
%         gamma_in  : Initial timestep
%         gamma_fin : Final timestep
%         nit       : Number of iteration for the decrease
%
%   Output parameters:
%         gamma     : Timestep at iteration t
%
%   This plugin compute a new timestep at each iteration. It make a log
%   decreasing timestep from gamma_in to gamma_fin in nit iterations.
%   To use this plugin, define:
%
%       param.do_ts=@(x) log_decreasing_ts(x, gamma_in, gamma_fin, nit);
%
%   in the structure of optional argument of the solver.
