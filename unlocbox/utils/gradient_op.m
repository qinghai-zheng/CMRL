function [dx, dy] = gradient_op(I, wx, wy)
%GRADIENT_OP 2 Dimentional gradient operator
%   Usage:  [dx, dy] = gradient_op(I)
%           [dx, dy] = gradient_op(I, wx, wy)
%
%   Input parameters:
%         I     : Input data 
%         wx    : Weights along x
%         wy    : Weights along y
%
%   Output parameters:
%         dx    : Gradient along x
%         dy    : Gradient along y
%
%   Compute the 2-dimentional gradient of I. If the input I is a cube. This
%   function will compute the gradient of all image and return two cubes.
