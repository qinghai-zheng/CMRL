function I = div_op(dx, dy, wx, wy)
%DIV_OP Divergence operator in 2 dimentions
%   Usage:  I = div_op(dx, dy)
%           I = div_op(dx, dy, wx, wy)
%
%   Input parameters:
%         dx    : Gradient along x
%         dy    : Gradient along y
%         wx    : Weights along x
%         wy    : Weights along y
%
%   Output parameters:
%         I     : Output divergence image 
%
%   Compute the 2-dimentional divergence of an image. If a cube is given,
%   it will compute the divergence of all images in the cube.
%
%   Warning this function compute the divergence operator defined as minus
%   the adjoint of the gradient
%
%           div  = - grad'
